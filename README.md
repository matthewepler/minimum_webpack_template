# Blank Webpack Project

Need to test ES6 code but getting Node errors?

Want to do a simple test with a webpack plugin before throwing it in a
project?

Need a barebones setup for something that will live on the web but doesn't
require a framework like React?

Well this is for you. You're welcome. 

# Usaage

2. `cd` into directory
3. `yarn install`
